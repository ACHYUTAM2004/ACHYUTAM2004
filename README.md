## 💻 Projects

## Music Genre Classification App 🎵
A machine learning-based app that classifies music genres from audio files by extracting features (MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast) using Librosa employing a TensorFlow/Keras model with a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions; it overcomes varying audio qualities through noise reduction and feature normalization, with plans to expand the dataset, support live audio input, and recommend similar artists.

## Resume Ranking System 📄
An automated system categorizes and ranks resumes into domains like Data Science, Web Design, and Java Development. It leverages Python with PyPDF2 and spaCy for data extraction, Supabase for storage, and a Streamlit interface for presentation. The system efficiently handles multiple resume formats using a weighted scoring algorithm. Upcoming enhancements include NLP-based semantic analysis, domain-specific feedback, and multilingual support.

## ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Power BI Dashboard 🏆
An interactive Power BI dashboard for ICC Champions Trophy 2025, analyzing 100+ players’ batting, bowling, fielding, and overall stats across the tournament. It has 10+ team comparisons with drill-down features, delivering 30+ performance insights for individual players.

## Comment Toxicity Classification App 💬
A deep learning-powered app that detects toxic comments by classifying text (toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate) using an LSTM-based model implemented in Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch and a simple Streamlit UI; it effectively processes unstructured text while balancing precision and recall, and future improvements include multi-language support, domain-specific tuning, and sentiment analysis.

## Text Translation using Gemini Api 
A simple language translator web application built with Python and Streamlit. It leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to provide fast and accurate multi-language translations.
