# ðŸ’» Projects

## Music Genre Classification App ðŸŽµ
A machine learning-based app that classifies music genres from audio files by extracting features (MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast) using Librosa employing a TensorFlow/Keras model with a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions; it overcomes varying audio qualities through noise reduction and feature normalization, with future plans to expand the dataset, support live audio input, and recommend similar artists.

## Resume Ranking System ðŸ“„
An automated system that categorizes and ranks resumes into domains like Data Science, Web Design, and Java Development by leveraging Python with PyPDF2 and spaCy for data extraction, Supabase for storage, and a Streamlit interface for presentation; it efficiently handles multiple resume formats using a weighted scoring algorithm, with upcoming enhancements including NLP-based semantic analysis, domain-specific feedback, and multilingual support.

## Movie Recommendation Android App ðŸŽ¥
An Android app that recommends movies based on user-selected genres by integrating a lightweight recommendation model (using content-based and collaborative filtering techniques developed in Python) with a Kotlin-based Material Design UI; it offers quick access to movie details such as ratings and synopses, with future plans to add personalized recommendations and integrate real-time data via the TMDb API.

## Comment Toxicity Classification App ðŸ’¬
A deep learning-powered app that detects toxic comments by classifying text into categories (toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate) using an LSTM-based model implemented in Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch and a simple Streamlit UI; it effectively processes unstructured text while balancing precision and recall, and future improvements include multi-language support, domain-specific tuning, and sentiment analysis.
